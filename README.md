I developed this python code to work with multiple loom files that were generated using the velocyto package, http://velocyto.org/.
I used the scvelo package, https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/, to read the loom files and perform additional analysis (not included in this file), and I used the pandas package to modify the observations of the loom file by manually modifying the cluster group of each cell based on the given .csv file.
